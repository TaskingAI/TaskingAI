## Why TaskingAI?

### Problems with existing solutions üôÅ

**LangChain** is a tool framework for LLM application development, but it faces practical limitations:

- **Statelessness**: Relies on client-side or external services for data management.
- **Scalability Challenges**: Statelessness impacts consistent data handling across sessions.
- **External Dependencies**: Depends on outside resources like model SDKs and vector storage.

**OpenAI's Assistant API** excels in delivering GPTs-like functionalities but comes with its own constraints:

- **Tied Functionalities**: Integrations like tools and retrievals are tied to each assistant, not suitable for multi-tenant applications.
- **Proprietary Limitations**: Restricted to OpenAI models, unsuitable for diverse needs.
- **Customization Limits**: Users cannot customize agent configuration such as memory and retrieval system.

### How TaskingAI solves the problem üòÉ

TaskingAI addresses these challenges with a **decoupled modular design** and **extensive model compatibility**, adhering to **open-source principles**.

Perfect for developers who need a scalable and customizable AI development environment, TaskingAI enhances project management with a **user-friendly UI console**. It supports development through **Client SDKs and REST APIs**, and its server efficiently stores data for various models. Importantly, TaskingAI natively supports **vector storage**, essential for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, thereby facilitating a seamless progression from prototype to production.

## Architecture

TaskingAI's architecture is designed with modularity and flexibility at its core, enabling compatibility with a wide spectrum of LLMs. This adaptability allows it to effortlessly support a variety of applications, from straightforward demos to sophisticated, multi-tenant AI systems. Constructed on a foundation of open-source principles, TaskingAI incorporates numerous open-source tools, ensuring that the platform is not only versatile but also customizable.

</p>

**[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)**: Functions as the frontend web server, efficiently routing traffic to the designated services within the architecture.

**Frontend ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [React](https://react.dev/))**: This interactive and responsive user interface is built with TypeScript and React, allowing users to smoothly interact with backend APIs.

**Backend ([Python](https://www.python.org/) + [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/))**: The backend, engineered with Python and FastAPI, offers high performance stemming from its asynchronous design. It manages business logic, data processing, and serves as the conduit between the frontend and AI inference services. Python's widespread use invites broader contributions, fostering a collaborative environment for continuous improvement and innovation.

**[TaskingAI-Inference](https://github.com/taskingai/taskingai-inference)**: Dedicated to AI model inference, this component adeptly handles tasks such as response generation and natural language input processing. It's another standout project within TaskingAI's suite of open-source offerings.

**TaskingAI Core Services**: Comprises various services including Model, Assistant, Retrieval, and Tool, each integral to the platform's operation.

**[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) + [PGVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)**: Serves as the primary database, with PGVector enhancing vector operations for embedding comparisons, crucial for AI functionalities.

**[Redis](https://www.redis.com/)**: Delivers high-performance data caching, crucial for expediting response times and bolstering data retrieval efficiency.

## Quickstart with Docker

A simple way to initiate self-hosted TaskingAI community edition is through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Git installed for cloning the repository.
- Python environment (above Python 3.8) for running the client SDK.

### Installation

First, clone the TaskingAI (community edition) repository from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taskingai/taskingai.git
cd taskingai
```

Inside the cloned repository, go to the docker directory and launch the services using Docker Compose.

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose -p taskingai up -d
```

Once the service is up, access the TaskingAI console through your browser with the URL http://localhost:8080.
The default username and password are `admin` and `TaskingAI321`.

### Upgrade

If you have already installed TaskingAI with a previous version and want to upgrade to the latest version, first update the repository.

```bash
git pull origin master
```

Then stop current docker service, upgrade to the latest version by pulling the latest image, and finally restart the service.

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose -p taskingai down
docker-compose -p taskingai pull
docker-compose -p taskingai up -d
```

Don't worry about data loss; your data will be automatically migrated to the latest version schema if needed.

### TaskingAI UI Console

**_<p style="text-align: center; font-size: small; ">Click the image above to view the TaskingAI Console Demo Video.</p>_**

### TaskingAI Client SDK

Once the console is up, you can programmatically interact with the TaskingAI server using the TaskingAI client SDK.

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed, and set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
Install the TaskingAI Python client SDK using pip.

```bash
pip install taskingai
```

Here is a client code example:

```python
import taskingai
from taskingai.assistant.memory import AssistantNaiveMemory

taskingai.init(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY', host='http://localhost:8080')

# Create a new assistant
assistant = taskingai.assistant.create_assistant(
    model_id="YOUR_MODEL_ID",
    memory=AssistantNaiveMemory(),
)

# Create a new chat
chat = taskingai.assistant.create_chat(
    assistant_id=assistant.assistant_id,
)

# Send a user message
taskingai.assistant.create_message(
    assistant_id=assistant.assistant_id,
    chat_id=chat.chat_id,
    text="Hello!",
)

# generate assistant response
assistant_message = taskingai.assistant.generate_message(
    assistant_id=assistant.assistant_id,
    chat_id=chat.chat_id,
)

print(assistant_message)
```

Note that the `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_MODEL_ID` should be replaced with the actual API key and chat completion model ID you created in the console.
