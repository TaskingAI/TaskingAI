We appreciate your interest in contributing to TaskingAI! Our project thrives on the contributions of our vibrant open source community, and your participation is welcomed. Below, you will find essential resources and instructions to guide you through the process:

[1. Getting Started](#getting-started)
[2. Issues](#issues)
[3. Pull Requests](#pull-requests)

## Getting Started

To promote a welcoming and positive experience, please familiarize yourself with our [code of conduct](https://github.com/TaskingAI/TaskingAI/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before starting your contribution journey. For instructions on setting up the codebase, consult our [DEVELOPERS.md](https://github.com/TaskingAI/TaskingAI/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md).

## Issues

Encountering bugs is a part of development; when you find one, please open an Issue to help us improve.

- Check our [current Issues](https://github.com/TaskingAI/TaskingAI/issues) to ensure your problem hasn't already been reported.
- Include a detailed description of the issue and steps to reproduce it. The more specific you are, including screenshots and URLs, the easier it will be for us to address the problem quickly.

## Pull Requests

Your Pull Requests are crucial to the growth of this project, and we look forward to each contribution. Here are important considerations:

- Verify no existing Pull Requests address the same issue. Connect your PR to any relevant existing Issues.
- We prioritize accepting the first effective PR submitted for each problem.
- Beginners might find [good first issue](https://github.com/TaskingAI/TaskingAI/labels/good%20first%20issue) tags helpful to start contributing.
- Ensure your PR description is detailed using our template to facilitate a faster review process. PRs without clear problem statements will be closed.

Before you submit your PR, make sure to keep the code clean:

- Go to your root directory and run `pip install pre-commit` first if you haven't already.
- Run `pre-commit install` to install the pre-commit hooks.
- Commit your changes. If there are any issues, wait for the pre-commit hooks to run and fix them, then commit again.

These checks will streamline the process and decrease the need for multiple revisions.
